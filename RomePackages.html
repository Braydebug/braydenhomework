<h4 class="a">Tour Overview</h4>
<p class="a">
    "When in Rome, do as the Romans do." We guess that means that while you're in Rome, go ahead and eat sumptuous Italian food (there are no calories on vacation), explore the ancient monuments while enjoying the city's vibrancy, and have fun! With Monograms, that's easy to do, as we've handled your travel details and given you more time to experience the city. 
    Rome is one of the world's most fascinating and beautiful cities offering ancient structures, historical monuments, fantastic shopping, and mouth-watering cuisine. 
    To ensure you get the most out of your Rome trip, we've arranged your hotel reservations, daily breakfast, and sightseeing. 
    Plus, a-one-of-a-kind feature offered only by Monograms is the service of a Local Host®, someone who is there for you throughout your Rome vacation to answer questions, offer insights, arrange activities, and help ensure your vacation runs smoothly.
    Your Italy trip begins the moment you arrive in Rome, where we can pick you up at the airport and take you to your selected hotel. 
    Here, your Local Host will greet you with a warm benvenuto, help you get settled, and give you a set of materials to familiarize you with the city. 
    The next morning, after included breakfast, we'll pick you up at your hotel for guided sightseeing with an expert local guide. We'll take you to some of Rome's most historical sites, such as the Colosseum, built in the 1st century to hold 50,000 spectators and most famous for its gladiator fights; the Roman Forum, dating back 2,000 years to the peak of the Roman Empire; and St. Peter's Square and Basilica, built in 313 AD. We'll also take you to the Vatican Museums, where you'll see its amazing treasures, and the Sistine Chapel, where you'll view Michelangelo's The Last Judgment and his famous ceiling paintings.
    And never fear...we've secured VIP access for you, which means you get to skip the lines. 
    That's over four hours of time saved just at the Vatican, Colosseum, and the Roman Forum. 
    After all, why wait in line like all the other tourists when you can be up close and personal with these iconic landmarks?
    You'll also have time to explore on your own. We know there are endless opportunities, so your Local Host will be on hand to offer suggestions and help you arrange activities. 
    You may want to shop at the designer Italian boutiques along Via Condotti, visit Rome's catacombs, take one of its many walking tours, or maybe take an excursion to Tivoli, where Hadrian built his villa at the height of the Roman Empire. 
    Be sure to toss a coin in the Trevi Fountain, which is said to ensure your return to Rome!At Monograms, our goal is to ensure your vacation is all you want it to be. 
    That's why on this Rome trip we've arranged your hotel reservations, sightseeing, breakfast, and guides. 
    All you have to do is bring your camera, come prepared to have fun, and "do as the Romans do!" 
    Add the comfort of knowing you'll have a Local Host throughout your stay in Rome, and you've got a vacation of a lifetime!Included Features:Guided sightseeing; inside visits and special features are shown in UPPERCASE. 
    ALSO INCLUDED: personal headset for included city sightseeing.</p>
