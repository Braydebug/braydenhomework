    <img src="airplane.jpeg" alt="Airplane Flying" style="width:30%; overflow: hidden; float: right; border-radius: 20px; padding: 10px;">
    <p>Established in 2015 our travel agency has thrived in giving you the best traveling experience you can have.
        We specialize in European vacations and are excited to share our European experiences with you. 
        Our Europe travel agents will listen closely and utilize their travel expertise and partnerships with hotels and tour operators to create a personalized vacation experience just for you!
    </p>
<p>Europe consists of timeless landscapes, quiet country roads, poppy fields, and stone farmhouses encircled by elegant cypresses. 
    Discover treasures of medieval villages perched on hillsides cloaked with dark forests hiding truffle secrets. 
    Listen to fountains splash in sunny squares or waves sweeping the shore. 
    Walk along old pilgrimage routes past roadside crosses and tiny chapels or follow in artistsâ€™ footsteps by seeing where they created their masterpieces and the museums that now protect those works. 
    With so many cultural influences over the past centuries, Europe has become a vacation spot that never disappoints. 
    The diversity across Europe can only be experienced first-hand, and thankfully the European Union has welcomed many travelers and made international travel easier than many can imagine.
