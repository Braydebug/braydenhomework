<h1>Fundamentals of Baseball</h1>
<h2>Out hustle. Out work. Out Play.</h2>
<p>Baseball is the only sport where there is two teams of players, but is played by a bunch of individuals. 
Each position has their own specific route they need to take when the ball is hit in to play. 
Each position has to know where the ball needs to go if it is hit to them.
Each position must react to the ball and trust their teammates are taking their correct route for the play.
There are so many things that can happen after each pitch that the basic fundamentals should be natural to the player.
There is no time to think "how should I field this ball" or "how do I adjust to hit this curveball."
All of those things should be practiced and come naturally, so you have time to react to where the opposing team is at.
These are specific fundamentals in the game of baseball that you should know in order to be a successful ball player.
