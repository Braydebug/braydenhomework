    <h4>Travelling In Paris</h4>
    <p>Paris is synonymous with the finest things that culture can offer — in art, fashion, food, literature, and ideas. 
        On this tour, your Paris-savvy Rick Steves guide will immerse you in the very best of the City of Light: the Louvre, Orsay, and Orangerie museums, Notre-Dame Cathedral, Sainte-Chapelle, and Versailles Palace. 
        You'll also enjoy guided neighborhood walks through the city's historic heart as well as quieter moments to slow down and savor the city's intimate cafés, colorful markets, and joie de vivre. 
    </p>
<h4>Paris’ Riverside Bouquinistes</h4>
    <p>The used-book sellers (bouquinistes) you see along the Seine around Notre-Dame are a Parisian fixture. 
        These literary entrepreneurs pride themselves on their easygoing style. With flexible hours and virtually no overhead, they run their businesses as they have since the mid-1500s, when shops and stalls lined most of the bridges in Paris. 
        In 1557, these merchants were labeled as thieves for selling forbidden Protestant pamphlets during the Wars of Religion (Parisians were staunchly Catholic).
        The term bouquinistes (boo-keen-eest) probably comes from the Dutch word boeckin, meaning "small book." 
        First using wheelbarrows to transport and sell their goods, these hardy entrepreneurs eventually fastened trays to the parapets of the bridges with thin leather straps. 
        After the Revolution, business boomed when entire libraries were liberated from nobles or clergymen and wound up for sale cheap on the banks of the Seine. 
        In 1891, bouquinistes received permission to permanently attach their boxes to the quaysides. 
        Today, the waiting list to become one of Paris' 250 bouquinistes is eight years.
        Each bouquiniste is given four boxes, all of a specified size, and rent is paid only for the stone on which the boxes rest (around €100 per year). 
        The most coveted spots are awarded based on seniority. 
        Maintenance costs, including the required vert wagon paint (the green color of old train cars), are paid by the bouquinistes. 
        With little overhead, prices are usually cheaper than in most shops. 
        Bouquinistes must be open at least four days a week, or they lose their spot. 
        Wednesdays are best (when school is out), and warm, dry days are golden (notice that every item is wrapped in protective plastic). 
        And yes, they do leave everything inside when they lock up at night; metal bars and padlocks keep things safe. 
        Though their main items may be vintage books, these days tourists prefer posters and magnets.</p>
        <h4>On Your Own Paris Itinerary</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Day 1: Welcome to Paris</strong><br> We'll gather at our hotel in Paris at 3 p.m. for a short meeting and orientation stroll around our neighborhood, followed by a panoramic tour of the City of Light aboard a private bus. Then we'll get acquainted with one another over a delicious "Welcome to Paris" dinner together.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Day 2: The Historic Heart of Paris</strong><br> Let's begin where Paris did, on the Ile de la Cité. Your guide will lead a walking tour of the city's early history, including a pair of the world's most significant medieval Gothic churches: the resilient and legendary Notre-Dame Cathedral and a visit to the exquisite Sainte-Chapelle. After free time for lunch, we'll regroup and stroll through the bohemian Latin Quarter, named for the language you'd have heard on these streets if you walked them in the Middle Ages. Then you'll be set free for the afternoon to explore more of the city.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Day 3: Montmartre and a Seine Cruise</strong><br> This morning we'll hop on the Métro, then hike up Montmartre to tour the colorful neighborhood that was the haunt of artistic geniuses a century ago — including Van Gogh, Picasso, and Renoir — and generations of hopeful artists since. We'll end our walk with spectacular views of Paris from the Sacré-Cœur Basilica. After free time for lunch and exploration, we'll regroup this evening to enjoy dinner together before embarking on a dreamy Seine River cruise.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Day 4: The Marais District and the Louvre</strong><br> We'll begin our day with a walking tour through Paris' diverse, history-layered Marais district. As we walk, we'll learn about enlightened 17th-century urban planning at the beautiful Place des Vosges, the cultural roots of the Jewish Quarter, and how the French Revolution grew from this neighborhood. This evening, Europe's greatest museum — the Louvre — is open late, and we'll take full advantage of that. You'll come face to face with the works of Raphael, Delacroix, and Leonardo, and timeless treasures including Mona Lisa, Winged Victory, Venus de Milo, and hundreds more.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Day 5: All Day at Château de Versailles</strong><br> Today we'll explore the elaborate palace that Louis XIV, XV, and XVI called home. We'll make the 30-minute train trip to Versailles, where we'll have a guided tour of the dazzling Hall of Mirrors and other sumptuous rooms of the palace. You'll then have free time to wander through the expansive gardens and visit the farm animals at Marie Antoinette's hamlet — or zip back to Paris early via one of the frequent trains.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Day 6: Masterpieces of Paris</strong><br> This morning we'll tour the Orsay Museum, home to the world's greatest collection of Impressionist art with works by Monet and Degas, to Cézanne and Gauguin, and beyond. Then you'll be free to visit the nearby Orangerie Museum featuring Monet's magnificent water lilies and other fine works by Renoir, Matisse, Picasso, and more. Or visit other places covered by your included 6-Day Paris Museum Pass, such as the Rodin Museum, or the military museum of Les Invalides. Tonight we'll enjoy a farewell feast together, sharing travel memories and toasting new friends. Salut!</li>
